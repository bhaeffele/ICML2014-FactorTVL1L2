Overview:

This is code to do structured matrix factorizations based on the
formulation given in the "Applications" section of the paper:

Haeffele, B., Young, E., and Vidal, R. "Structured low-rank matrix 
factorization: Optimality, algorithm, and applications to image 
processing." ICML. 2014.

The code here is a generalization of the formulation given in the
paper as it also includes options to include additional 'non-factorized'
variables in the optimization and to put non-negative constraints on the 
factorized variables.  This more general formulation is also shown to have 
similar properties regarding global optimality of local-minima as shown in 
the following:

Haeffele, Benjamin D., and Rene Vidal. "Global Optimality in Tensor 
Factorization, Deep Learning, and Beyond." arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.07540
2015.

Files:

FactorTVL1L2_v1.m - The main function.

ToyExample.m - A script with simulated data to show how to run the code.

CalciumImagingExample.m - A script that calls the code with real Calcium 
    imaging data.

Imgs1375.mat - Real Calcium imaging data used in the calcium imaging 
    example script. The data were taken from awake mouse auditory cortex 
    transfected with GCaMP5G.  The x-axis of the image frame is 
    approximately 470 microns, and the y-axis is approximately 75 microns.  
    The data were sampled with a frame rate of 5Hz.

proximalTVL1L2.m - Function to calculate the proximal operator of the sum
    of the L1, L2, and Total-Variation norms, as given in equation (19) of
    the above paper.

mexProximalL1TV.cpp - The proximalTVL1L2.m function calls this mex file to 
    calculate the proximal operator of the L1+TV term.  The calculation is
    done by doing coordinate descent on the dual problem and checking the
    duality gap for the stopping criteria.  See below for instuctions on
    compiling.  Note that this mex file only gets called if TV 
    regularization is used, so for applications where TV 
    regularization is not needed it is not necessary to compile this.

mexProximalL1TV.mexw64 - Compiled mex file for 64-bit windows.  Other 
    platforms will need to compile this file.

L1TVprox.cpp/h - Library and header files for the mexProximalL1TV.cpp mex
    function.

GetLatticeIndex.m - Returns the pairs of neighboring indices for an
    8-connected 2D lattice (i.e. neighboring pixels of an image of a 
    given size).

MakeFourierD.m - Makes a dictionary of Fourier components as an example for
    the ToyExample.m script and for fitting background signals in Calcium
    imaging data.

MakeD.m - Make a dictionary of decaying explonential signals for the use in
    processing Calcium imaging data.

Compiling the mex file:

The implimentation was purposely written for ease of compilation (i.e. no 
external libraries, such as LAPACK, are required).  Assuming the mex C/C++
compiler is properly configured and that all of the source files are in the
current directory, the mex file should compile with the following command:

mex mexProximalL1TV.cpp L1TVprox.cpp
